Title: Modeling and Assessing Similarity of Drug Dissolutions Profiles

Description: Implementation of a model-based bootstrap approach for testing whether two formulations are similar. The package provides a function for fitting a pharmacokinetic model to time-concentration data and comparing the results for all five candidate models regarding the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). The candidate set contains a First order, Hixson-Crowell, Higuchi, Weibull and a logistic model. The assessment of similarity implemented in this package is performed regarding the maximum deviation of the profiles. See Moellenhoff et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7689> for details.
